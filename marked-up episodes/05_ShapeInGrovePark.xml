    <segment type="intro" voice="cecil">Close your eyes. Let my words wash over you. You are safe now. Welcome to Night Vale. </segment>
    <segment type="main" voice="cecil"><ref type="group" spec="historians">Local historians</ref> are protesting the removal of <ref type="nonperson" spec="parkShape">the Shape in Grove Park that No One
        Acknowledges or Speaks About</ref>. While their protest has been hampered by the fact that none of
        them will acknowledge or speak about it, they did — through a system of gestures and
        grimaces — convey the message that, whatever the Shape is, and whatever its effects on
        nearby neighborhoods, it is a Night Vale landmark and should be protected. The Shape itself
        offered no comment — only a low moaning and gelatinous quiver. <ref type="group" spec="cityCouncil">The City Council</ref> would not
        provide any reason for the removal, but did say that any work in <ref type="place" spec="grovePark">Grove Park</ref> was making way
        for a new swing set, picnic area, and <ref type="object" spec="bloodstone">bloodstone circle</ref>, which we all can agree are good
        contributions to the community. </segment>
    <segment type="news" voice="cecil"><ref type="place" spec="greenMarket">The Night Vale Green Market Co-Op</ref> announced today that, after fifteen years, they will
        begin selling fruits and vegetables. <ref type="person" spec="tristanCortez">Green Market Board President Tristan Cortez</ref> said that
        recent customer surveys indicated that shoppers have grown tired of empty pickup trucks and
        vacant tents lining the <ref type="place" spec="cityHall">City Hall</ref> parking lot every Sunday morning in the summer and fall.
        Cortez said that research indicates that consumers are more likely to buy products if they
        are available and for sale, and that Green Market and Grocery shoppers tend to purchase food
        items. Cortez said that the decision to sell food at the Green Market was a controversial
        one, as many board members and Co-Op shareholders feel fruit and vegetable sales will
        interfere with their ongoing secretive domestic espionage operations. When reached for
        comment, our source within <ref type="group" spec="secPol">the Secret Police</ref> only breathed heavily into the phone while
        tapping an as-yet uncracked code into the receiver. </segment>
    <segment type="news" voice="cecil"><ref type="person" spec="michaelSandero">Michael Sandero</ref>, starting quarterback for <ref type="group" spec="nvSportsTeam">the Night Vale Scorpions</ref>, has reportedly
        grown a second head. It is not currently known whether this is a result of the previously
        reported lightning strike, or just another odd coincidence in the kid’s odd life. People in
        the know say that the new head is better looking and smarter than the first one, and even
        <ref type="person" spec="mrsSandero">Michael’s mother</ref> has issued a statement indicating that she likes it much better than her
        son and that she will be changing the rankings on the public “Which of My Children I Like
        Best” board outside her house. Sandero could not be reached for comment. Probably. We didn’t
        try. </segment>
    <segment type="psa" voice="cecil">Friends, listeners; there’s a real <ref type="nonperson" spec="spider">tarantula</ref> problem here in Night Vale. Many residents
        have called in to report that illiteracy, unwanted pregnancy, and violent crime are on the
        rise in the tarantula communities. <ref type="group" spec="animalControl">Animal control</ref> is addressing these concerns through after
        school programs called “Teach a Spider to Read — Stop the Madness.” Those interesting in
        volunteering should stand in their bathtubs and weep until it is all gone. Nothing left. You
        can let go now. Let go. Shhhhh. Let go. </segment>
    <segment type="advert" voice="cecil">And now a message from our sponsor. Tired of your home? Sick of comfort? Come to <ref type="place" spec="vacantLotHole">the
        Hole</ref> in <ref type="place" spec="vacantLot">the Vacant Lot</ref> out back of <ref type="place" spec="ralphs">the Ralph’s</ref> and huddle with <ref type="group" spec="huddlers">Us</ref>. Who are we? Good
        question. Come to the Hole in the Vacant Lot out back of the Ralph’s and huddle with Us. Why
        do we want you to come? Why did we spend money for this airtime? We understand you are
        confused. But: Hole, Vacant Lot, Ralph’s, huddle, Us. For the low-low price. Act today. Or
        tomorrow. Not Wednesday. Wednesday is no good for Us. Anyway, we’re almost out of airtime,
        so just come on down to the Hole in the Vacant Lot out back of the Ralph’s and huddle with
        Us. Or else. </segment>
    <segment type="news" voice="cecil">Back to our regularly scheduled programming. Ladies and gentlemen, the rumor mill is
        abuzz. We’ve had a celebrity sighting in our little burgh! <ref type="person" spec="josie">Old Woman Josie</ref> and <ref type="group" spec="angels">one of her
        angel friends</ref> reportedly saw <ref type="culture" spec="ritaHayworth">Rita Hayworth</ref> getting gas at <ref type="place" spec="fuelNGo">the Fuel ‘n Go</ref> over by the bowling
        alley. Rita Hayworth, ladies and gentlemen! Right here in Night Vale. Can you believe it?
        Old Woman Josie said Rita was looking a bit older, moderately obese, and considerably more
        Hispanic, but the angel assured her it was indeed Rita. He is an angel after all…he would
        know, right? Wow! Rita Hayworth! Right here in Night Vale! Just imagine! </segment>
    <segment type="main" voice="cecil">Update on <ref type="nonperson" spec="parkShape">the Shape Formerly in Grove Park that No One Acknowledges or Speaks About</ref>: it
        seems <ref type="group" spec="cityCouncil">the City Council</ref>, in their superhuman mercy and all-seeing glory have chosen to move
        the Shape directly in front of our own radio station, where it is continuing to be what can
        only be described as…indescribable. The Shape was not available for comment as I could find
        no one willing to speak to it…or even meet my eye when I mentioned it. It has occurred to me
        that I may be the only one able to see it. Now that I think about it, I have also never
        bothered to actually check whether this mic is attached to any sort of <ref type="object" spec="recordingEquip">recording or
        broadcasting device</ref>. And it is possible that I am alone in <ref type="abstract" spec="void">an empty universe</ref>, speaking to no
        one, unaware that the world is held aloft merely by my delusions and my smooth, sonorous
        voice. More on this story as it develops, I say, possibly only to myself. </segment>
    <segment type="news" voice="cecil"><ref type="group" spec="communityTheater">The Night Vale Community Theater</ref> is holding auditions for its fall show “Once On This
        Island.” Interested thespians should bring a head shot and resume to <ref type="place" spec="auditorium">the Recreation Center
        auditorium</ref> on Thursday night. All auditionees must perform a one-minute monologue and sing
        one song. Bring sheet music if you would like piano accompaniment. Auditionees will also be
        required to do a cold reading, and give blood and stool samples along with mandatory
        radiation testing following the auditions. Do not sing anything from South Pacific. People
        of color are urged to audition, as Night Vale Community Theater is an equal-opportunity
        employer. Also, actors with long-range sniper training, FORTRAN computer programming, and
        top-notch wilderness survival skills are a plus. Final casting will be announced in secret
        via dirigible. No one can ever know. </segment>
    <segment type="news" voice="cecil">Update on the <ref type="place" spec="greenMarket">Green Market</ref> situation from earlier in our broadcast. Everything is
        exactly the same as when we last reported on it. There is no new information. </segment>
    <segment type="science" voice="cecil">Listeners, do you ever think about <ref type="object" spec="moon">the moon</ref>? I was sitting outside last night looking
        at the moon and I thought, does anyone actually know what that thing is? Have there been any
        studies on this? I went to ask <ref type="person" spec="carlos">Carlos</ref>, but he hasn’t been seen much since <ref type="person" spec="tellyBarber">that treacherous
        Telly’s</ref> vile haircut. The moon’s weird though, right? It’s there, and there, and then
        suddenly it’s not. And it seems to be pretty far up. Is it watching us? If not, what is it
        watching instead? Is there something more interesting than us? Hey, watch us moon! We may
        not always be the best show in the universe, but we try. This has been today’s Children’s
        Fun Fact Science Corner. </segment>
    <segment type="news" voice="cecil">Speaking of which, <ref type="group" spec="schoolDistrict">the Night Vale School District</ref> has announced some changes to the
        elementary school curriculum. They are as follows: In response to parent feedback, history
        class will focus more heavily on textbook readings and traditional exams, rather than live
        ammo drills. <ref type="abstract" spec="science">Geology</ref> is adding a new type of rock on the grounds that it’s been a while
        since anyone has done that. The new type of rock is “<ref type="object" spec="vimbee">vimbee</ref>,” and it is categorized by its
        pale blue color, and the fact that it is completely edible. Points will be awarded to the
        first student to discover a real-world example of it. Math and English are switching names.
        Their curriculum will stay exactly the same. Astronomy will now be conducting stargazing
        sessions only with blindfolds on every participant, in order to protect them from the
        existential terror of the void. Also, <ref type="culture" spec="pluto">Pluto</ref> has been declared imaginary. All classrooms will
        be equipped with at least one teacher physically present for the entire instruction period.
        Astral projection will no longer be used in any classroom situation. Finally, in addition to
        the current foreign language offerings of <ref type="language" spec="spanish">Spanish</ref>, <ref type="language" spec="french">French</ref>, and <ref type="language" spec="modSumerian">Modified Sumerian</ref>, schools
        will now be offering <ref type="language" spec="doubleSpanish">Double Spanish</ref>, <ref type="language" spec="weirdSpanish">Weird Spanish</ref>, <ref type="language" spec="copticSpanish">Coptic Spanish</ref>, <ref type="language" spec="russian">Russian</ref>,
        and <ref type="language" spec="unmodSumerian">Unmodified Sumerian</ref>. </segment>
    <segment type="main" voice="cecil">And now a continuation of our previous investigation into whether I am literally the
        only person in the world, speaking to myself in a fit of madness caused by my inability to
        admit the tragedy of my own existence. <ref type="person" spec="intern">Leland</ref>, our newest intern, recently brought me a cup
        of <ref type="object" spec="coffee">coffee</ref>. He is no longer in my field of vision, but I do still have the cup of coffee,
        which is well made and is given me the needed pick-me-up to continue considering this
        terrifying possibility. Is it possible that I only imagined Leland, and forgot making myself
        this cup of coffee? But then, who would have grown this coffee? Where was this coffee cup
        procured from? Oh, Leland’s back in the room. He’s waving at me — hello, Leland — and he’s
        saying…wait, what was that, Leland? I see. He’s saying that <ref type="nonperson" spec="parkShape">the Shape</ref> has turned a molten
        red and is causing small whirlwinds in front of our radio station doors. There is apparently
        a sound of a great many voices chanting as though it were an army giving out a battle cry
        before raining down destruction on our arid little hamlet. Oh? He has stopped shouting, and
        is now writing furiously on a piece of paper. I have to say, Leland’s existence, as well as
        his finally speaking about the Shape that No One Else Would Speak About, has reassured me
        greatly about my lonely and solipsistic vigil here at this microphone. He is handing me the
        note — thank you, Leland — lemme see here…ahh. It says that <ref type="group" spec="cityCouncil">the City Council</ref> believes the
        reason for the violent reaction of the Shape Formerly in Grove Park that No One Acknowledges
        or Speaks About is because I have been acknowledging and speaking about it, which has made
        it angry. They urge me to stop speaking of it, and never do it again, and in exchange
        they’ll move it somewhere else so we can get our front loading zone back. After brief
        consideration…I have decided to accept the Council’s offer, because they are trustworthy
        leaders looking out for our better future, and also because Leland just got vaporized by a
        strange red light emanating from the station entrance. To the family of Leland, we thank you
        for his service to the cause of community radio, and join you in mourning his loss. And,
        without further ado, nor ever again mentioning anything we shouldn’t, let’s go to the
        weather. </segment>
    <segment type="weather" voice="weather">[“Jerusalem" by Dan Bern] </segment>
    <segment type="closing" voice="cecil">Hello listeners. In breaking news, the sky. The earth. Life. Existence as an unchanging
        plane with horizons of birth and death in the faint distance. We have nothing to speak
        about. There never was. Words are an unnecessary trouble. Expression is time wasting away.
        Any communication is just a yelp in the darkness. Ladies, gentlemen, listeners, you. I am
        speaking now but I am saying nothing. I am just making noises and, as it happens, they are
        organized in words and you should not draw meaning from this. The service for <ref type="person" spec="intern">Leland</ref> will be
        lovely. We will throw flowers and weep. He will be buried in the break room as is the
        custom. His family will come and moon about the coffee as though we have answers. We do not
        have answers. I am not certain that we even have questions. I have chosen to not be certain
        of anything at all. This is Cecil, generally, speaking to you, metaphorically, for Night
        Vale Community Radio. And I would like to say in the most nebulous terms possible, and with
        no real world implications or insinuations of objective meaning: Goodnight, listeners.
        Goodnight. </segment>
