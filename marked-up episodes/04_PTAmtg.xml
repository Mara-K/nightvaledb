    <segment type="intro" voice="cecil">The sun has grown so very, very old. How long cold, fading death? How long? Welcome to
        Night Vale. </segment>
    <segment type="main" voice="cecil">Our top story: Last night’s <ref type="group" spec="pta">Night Vale PTA</ref> meeting ended in bloodshed as <ref type="object" spec="dimensionalRift">a rift in
        space-time</ref> split open in <ref type="place" spec="auditorium">the Main Street Recreation Center Auditorium</ref>, setting loose several
        confused and physically aggressive <ref type="nonperson" spec="dinosaur">pteranodons</ref>. The glowing portal remained open and
        shrieked incessantly, an unholy sound that witnesses say resembled noisy urchin children
        caught in a combine harvester, and then slowed down and amped up through some kind of open
        source, easy-to-use audio editing software. The pteranodons mostly attacked women with
        <ref type="object" spec="glasses">glasses</ref>. Authorities are still unsure why, as Night Vale’s only flying dinosaur expert, <ref type="person" spec="joelEisenberg">Joel
        Eisenberg</ref>, still has not recovered from last year’s bout with <ref type="abstract" spec="throatSpiders">throat spiders</ref>. It took most
        of an hour to corral the panicked beasts back into the vortex and resume the meeting, which
        had mostly been upon recent lunchroom price hikes, and had devolved into name calling
        because <ref type="person" spec="susanWillman">Susan Willman</ref> called <ref type="person" spec="dianeCrayton">Diane Crayton</ref>’s son <ref type="person" spec="joshCrayton">Josh</ref> “a bit tubby,” and that “maybe he
        needs a financial incentive to eat less.” In this reporter’s opinion, Susan Willman is
        dangerously obsessed with the New York Times best-selling Freakonomics books. Dangerously
        so. Fortunately, no one was injured or killed in the incident, although experts from
        <ref type="group" spec="contractor">Timothy’s Auditorium Repair Contractors Inc</ref>. estimates close to $750,000 in damage has been
        done to the Rec Center Auditorium. And that cost includes free storm windows and a
        complementary seasonal installation consultation. </segment>
    <segment type="news" voice="cecil">It’s <ref type="abstract" spec="election">election</ref> season again, and you know what that means! <ref type="group" spec="secPol">Sheriff’s Secret Police</ref> will
        be coming by to collect certain family members so that everyone votes for <ref type="group" spec="cityCouncil">the correct
        council seats</ref> and there’s no confusion. These family members will be held in a secure and
        undisclosed location, which everyone knows is <ref type="place" spec="mineShaft">the Abandoned Mine Shaft outside of town</ref>. But,
        don’t let the name fool you, listeners: it’s been used for years for so many kidnappings and
        illegal detentions that the Abandoned Mine Shaft outside of town is actually a pretty nice
        location these days, featuring king-sized beds, free wifi, and <ref type="culture" spec="hbo">HBO</ref>. Also torture cubicles,
        but I don’t think anyone’s going to make the Council use those. Remember, this is America.
        Vote correctly, or never see your loved ones again. This message brought to you by the City
        Council. </segment>
    <segment type="news" voice="cecil">The <ref type="object" spec="newspaper">Night Vale Daily Journal</ref> today announced that due to the recent economic downturn,
        they will start running ads on the front page. Any business interested in running one of
        these Platinum Premium ads should contact editor <ref type="person" spec="leanneHart">Leanne Hart</ref>. Hart mentioned that they have
        also created a <ref type="abstract" spec="writing">“Write Your Own News Story”</ref> program for interested citizens. Because every
        writer has been laid off, the Daily Journal now needs these community contributions to
        supply Night Vale with important news and features. The first Platinum Premium ad runs next
        Monday and features the terrified face of an infant primate with a superimposed spoon that
        has been stone-sharpened to a rough point, and the tagline “Better use <ref type="culture" spec="tide">Tide</ref>.” Hart also said
        that last year’s explosion that decimated the Daily Journal’s distribution plant is still
        totally an accident, and would like her insurance rep to call her back. Please. Call her
        back. </segment>
    <segment type="main" voice="cecil">This just came across the wire: <ref type="group" spec="secPol">The Secret Police</ref> have issued a new statement shedding
        more light onto last night’s <ref type="group" spec="pta">PTA</ref> meeting incident. <ref type="object" spec="dimensionalRift">The noisy portal</ref> and subsequent <ref type="nonperson" spec="dinosaur">dinosaur</ref>
        attack that brutally interrupted discussion of swing set repairs on the elementary school
        playground stayed open long after <ref type="place" spec="auditorium">Recreation Center</ref> employees thought they had rounded up
        all of the ancestral avian beasts, and authorities warn that there is still at least one
        more pteranodon on the loose. Citizens should cover themselves with a low-SPF sunscreen and
        hide in a tiled bathroom. Several curious handball players in the court next to the
        auditorium actually popped their heads into the portal — just to see what was on the other
        side of the vortex — and came back dramatically changed. The players aged several thousand
        years in what bystanders experienced as only a few seconds. Those handball players now
        straddle the unenviable border of millennially wizened and cripplingly insane. Since
        <ref type="abstract" spec="health">psychological and emotional damages are no longer considered valid claims by the greater
        medical insurance community</ref>, we are still reporting zero injuries. We’ll update you as
        further details surface in our special ongoing and very special coverage of <ref type="culture" spec="watergate">Pteranodon
        Attack-Gate</ref>. Are we safe from dinosaurs? No way. </segment>
    <segment type="psa" voice="cecil"><ref type="group" spec="cityCouncil">City Council</ref> has asked me to read the following message: If you notice strange auras
        around any of the following objects in your house: blender, shower head, <ref type="nonperson" spec="dog">dog</ref>, husband, wife,
        table, chair, doorknob, baseboard, vacation souvenirs or photos, collectibles of any kind
        (especially those depicting or involving <ref type="nonperson" spec="horse">horses</ref>), DVDs (especially <ref type="culture" spec="tv">Cliffhanger</ref>, <ref type="culture" spec="tv">There’s
        Something About Mary</ref>, and <ref type="culture" spec="tv">The Wire 4th season</ref>), and any bagged lettuce from <ref type="place" spec="california">California</ref> or
        <ref type="place" spec="mexico">Mexico</ref>, please, report to the Council for indefinite detention. </segment>
    <segment type="news" voice="cecil">Speaking of <ref type="group" spec="cityCouncil">the City Council</ref>, it voted this week to remove the large lead-plated door
        from the northeastern-most crook of <ref type="place" spec="radonCanyon">Radon Canyon</ref> — you know, the area pulsing with green
        light and sotto voce basso humming. Proponents of the measure called the large yellow emblem
        and red lettering that spelled out: DANGER- PLUTONIUM- DO NOT OPEN DOOR- RISK OF <ref type="abstract" spec="death">DEATH</ref>-
        …were, at worst, an offensive eyesore and, at best, <ref type="abstract" spec="sf">a hacky sci-fi cliche</ref>. Many Night Vale
        citizens attended the meeting including, it was said, several angels — although no angel is
        admitted to have been present for the City Council meeting…or any other event ever, for that
        matter. Old Woman Josie agreed with the measure, adding that lead is a health hazard, and
        that the old door was nothing but a ticking time bomb. According to the meeting minutes,
        Josie said, “That old door. Oooh, that door! Someone’s gonna get some kind of lead
        poisoning!” Carlos, beautiful Carlos, tragically shorn of his locks, reportedly was the only
        dissenting voice. But it is not clear he actually opposed the measure, as the minutes only
        report him stating, “There is no time. No more time,” into a black rectangle in his hand,
        and then running, winded, from the Community Hall. According to Old Woman Josie, he was
        still absolutely perfect, and smelled of lavender chewing gum. </segment>
    <segment type="main" voice="cecil">More breaking news on the pteranodons. We humbly offer the following retractions from
        our previous reports: Secret Police are now reporting that the offending beasts were not
        pteranodons after all, but pterodactyls. Also, pteranodons aren’t even dinosaurs as this
        station previously stated — just winged reptiles that lived about 70 million years after
        pterodactyls. Finally, earlier we reported a death toll of zero when, in fact, the number is
        closer to 38. We regret these errors. </segment>
    <segment type="news" voice="cecil">It’s almost football season, and the Night Vale Scorpions are gearing up for a defense
        of the high school division title. But really, as long as we beat Desert Bluffs, fans and
        Hooded Figures alike will feel just fine. Coach Nazr al-Mujaheed told reporters he’s
        particularly excited for the progress junior quarterback Michael Sandero made during the
        off-season, after that sentient lightning bolt struck him and give him the strength of two
        Jeeps and the intelligence of a heavily concussed Rene Descartes. But, if Night Vale is
        going to beat their bitter rivals this year, and stave off the government-administered
        pestilence the follows a losing season record, Sandero will have to improve his accuracy.
        Last year, Sandero only completed two out of 130 pass attempt — most notably because he was
        in advanced stages of cerebral palsy, and because his throwing hand had been removed due to
        several overdue library books. Apparently the off-season lightning strike had healed Sandero
        of his terminal ailments and court-ordered amputations, and he’s ready to take on Desert
        Bluffs, which is probably the worst team ever. God, they’re dreadful. </segment>
    <segment type="personal" voice="cecil">And now, an editorial. Let’s talk for a moment about apartment building etiquette. Now,
        I myself live in an apartment building, and there is a compassion and acceptance you have to
        have for a certain level of annoyance. It’s people in close proximity to each other, and so
        there will be some things that you don’t like, and still have to let go. But other things
        are absolutely unacceptable! For instance, a certain level of strange radiating light or
        heat on shared walls is expected, but any oozings or visible membranes are rude and
        thoughtless to all of your neighbors. Gibbering, howling, and chants in long-dead languages
        are the kind of thing that is fine at 1:00 PM, but absolutely not fine at 1:00 AM. We are
        all in this together. Put your trash in the cans, not in the hallway leading to the cans.
        Put on some clothes when standing in front of your windows, and keep any rituals or crazed
        experiments to hours in which no one is trying to sleep. It doesn’t have to be hard. </segment>
    <segment type="personal" voice="cecil">We have a very unexpected treat today, dear listeners. Live in the studio we have one
        of the mysterious Hooded Figures often seen around town. We did not actually invite him
        here, he just was waiting for us when we unlocked the studio this morning. He has not moved,
        nor spoken since then, and I’ll be honest: I am only guessing that “he” is a he, because
        physical attributes are hard to determine under these robes, and the face is entirely hidden
        in shadow as empty and as black as the void of space. But hey, we’re doin’ radio! He’s in a
        radio station. Let’s see if we can get an interview. Mr. Hooded Figure, how are you doing
        today? Huh…okay. Care to comment on the recent expansion of the Forbidden Dog Park? Any
        comments at all? Anything you’d like to tell the ordinary folk of Night Vale about your
        organization? Listeners, I’m sure you can here this. It’s not a problem with your radio or
        our transmitters. The Hooded Figure is making those noises in our studio. It’s pretty
        deafening, actually. Alright! I don’t think he’s going to stop, and he’s started to
        levitate, so, let’s go to the weather. </segment>

    <segment type="main" voice="cecil">Ladies and Gentlemen, we have just received word from Secret Police that the rip in
        space-time that opened at last night’s PTA meeting has been sealed at last. The final
        missing pterodactyl has been returned to its own timeline in either prehistoric or
        alternate-universe Night Vale. The creature’s lifeless body was found a dozen yards outside
        of the Dog Park entrance, stripped of all flesh, and with most of the organs inverted and
        strung around its exposed skull like an old fashioned soft meats crown, as worn by the 18th
        century religious leaders who settled our fair burgh. The dinosaur’s body was returned to
        the vortex, the gateway closed, and the PTA meeting rescheduled for next Tuesday at 6:00 PM.
        That meeting will continue to address the important issue of backpacks, and whether or not
        they are causing autism. There will also be a memorial service for the 38 parents and
        teachers who lost their lives in the attack — followed by a raffle. Remember, winners must
        be present at the time of the drawing to claim their prizes. City Council and Secret Police
        have issued a reminder that Night Vale citizens of all species and all geologic eras are not
        to enter, look at, or think too long about the Dog Park. This reminder, they say, is
        completely unrelated to anything that may or may not have happened today. </segment>
    <segment type="closing" voice="cecil">Coming up next, stay tuned for our one-hour special, “Morse Code for Trumpet Quintets.”
        And listeners, Night Vale is an ancient place, full of history and secrets — as we were
        reminded today. But it is also a place of the present moment, full of life, and of us. If
        you can hear my voice speaking live, then you know: we are not history yet. We are happening
        now. How miraculous is that? Goodnight, listeners. Goodnight. </segment>
    <segment type="proverb" voice="credits">Today’s proverb: What has four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in
        the evening? I don’t know, but I trapped it in my bedroom. Send help. </segment>
