#constrain later on with Schematron so that certain @spec values can only co-occur with certain //ref/@type values.
#Examples of specs:
#People: Carlos, Old Woman Josie, Hiram McDaniels, the Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives In Your House, Intern Dana
#Nonpeople: Khoshekh, the sun, the Shape in Grove Park, the Glow Cloud, Station Management, Feral Dogs (nonsentient but with apparent agency)
#Groups: Hooded Figures (singular and plural mention), Vague Yet Menacing Government Organization, Boy Scouts, the staff of Dark Owl Records
#Places: Radio station, Dog Park, the Sand Wastes, Desert Bluffs
#Cultural icons: Pink Floyd, Pledge of Allegiance
#Objects: airplane, coffee/coffee cup and other food items, microphone, cactus, bloodstone
#Languages: Spanish, Weird Spanish, Russian, Modified Sumerian
#Abstractions:  time, science, pseudoscience, hope, the void, love, prophecy, death

#End goal: Create a database: dropdown menu for each kind of @type contains that @typeâ€™s @spec values.
#Can search for references IN SEGMENT CONTEXT using interactive XQuery.
#Hope to expand this idea to larger fictional corpora like Doctor Who.
# If I mark up multiple references to the same thing in one segment, how do I keep them from repeating?
